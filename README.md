# Poker Advisor (Demo Project)

This project demonstrates how modern language models can be integrated into applicationsâ€”in this case, a poker advisor that suggests actions based on simulated game scenarios.

The poker advisor leverages OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini through LangChain to analyze randomly generated poker hands and situations, providing strategic recommendations (raise, call, or fold).

Note: This project is for demonstration and educational purposes only. It's intended to showcase the capabilities of AI technologies and is not meant for actual use in poker games or online gambling platforms. Using such tools in real gameplay situations may be unethical and could violate gaming rules or regulations.

Feel free to explore, learn, and adapt the provided examples to other AI-driven use cases.
